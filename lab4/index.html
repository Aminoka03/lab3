<h1><b>MY BIG LOVE</b></h1><br><br><br><br>
<h2>History of a <strong>BIG LOVE</strong></h2>
<p>
  <strong>My story</strong> began in the 11th grade, when we started preparing for <em>EHT</em>, our feelings began to arise.
  But we didn't know about it ourselves and were friends. Good friends. We have become closer and closer to each other.
  We've been through a lot of difficulties together. And they also overcame them. When everything was coming to an end,
  we began to realize that we could not live without each other. We became very close over the last year, and we understood each other more. 
  Since then, a new time has begun in our life. You could say that this is one of the best times of my life.<br><br><br>
  <strong>I want to tell you why I fell in love with him!!!</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>He is intelligent</li>
  <li>Handsome</li>
  <li>Caring</li>
  <li>And charismatic</li>
</ul>
<p>&mdash; It wasn't just those qualities that made me love him. Also, because he is always understanding, always listens and gives the right advice. 
He is the one who guided me to the right path.  He is not like anyone else. He is someone who could accept me for who I am. 
He always tries to make me happy and comes up with interesting dates. Also, he loves children and respects his parents.<br>
But, this is just a small part of why I love him.

  <strong><em>Since we were a year old, I gave him a notebooküòáüôÉ</em></strong>
